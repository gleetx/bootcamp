EXERCISE 3 (2 point):

1 thing is incorrect:
Need to check if poi_id is in pois before trying to grab country code

--------------------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 4 (2 point):

1 thing is incorrect:
Need to initialize empty dictionary before For loop, NOT during it. Overwriting true_dict at each iteration if not.

--------------------------------------------------------

EXERCISE 7 (2 point):

1 thing is incorrect:
Need to only build visit vectors for user ids in 'users' NOT for all user ids in 'checkins'. So instead you should iterate over 'users' or double check that a given user id is in 'users' before creating a visit vector for that user.

The demo cell still works correctly because the extra user's pois were not in  'pois'. The test cell will fail though. Highlight again that passing demo cell is not sufficient testing for your solution.
